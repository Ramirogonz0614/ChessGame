# ChessGame
How to code a chess game although unfinished due to time constraints, but overall well written.

This project is consisted of various classes such as the Piece, Board, BoardUtilities, Player, etc... that can be extended and added upon which helps with keeping the code readable. Using inheritance and the IDE eclipse made the project much easier to manage with less coding needed. By no means is this the only approach to writing such a complex game, but this is the path I decided to take.
I created this game to help me better understand the ideas of inheritance and polymorphism. The repetition involved with adding rules to all the individual pieces was the most difficult part of this for me but in the end it was the part that showed me the most since I had to keep trying. The bottom line is dont be discouraged by receiving errors and warnings but use them to help you push through and correct your mistakes.
